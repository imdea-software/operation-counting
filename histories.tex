\section{History Inclusion}
\label{sec:histories}

Though we seek to develop automated techniques to check observational
refinement between libraries, the definition of Section~\ref{sec:refinement}
does not suggest any practical means; it only suggests enumerating every
possible execution of every possible program. In this section we introduce an
equivalent notion based on concise abstractions of program executions called
\emph{histories}. Besides being independent of programs, this equivalent notion
helps expose the structure of the refinement problem, and suggests practical
means of automation which we develop in Section~\ref{sec:counting}.

\subsection{Histories}

For given sets $\<Methods>$ and $\<Vals>$ of methods and values, we fix a set
$\<Labels> = \<Methods> \x \<Vals> \x (\<Vals> \u \set{\bot})$ of
\emph{operation labels}, and denote the label $\tup{m,u,v}$ by $m(u) => v$. A
\emph{history} $h = \tup{O,<,f}$ is a partial order $<$ on a set $O \subseteq
\<Ops>$ of operation identifiers labeled by $f: O -> \<Labels>$ for which $f(o)
= m(u) => \bot$ implies $o$ is maximal in $<$. The \emph{history} $H(e)$ of
a well-formed execution $e \in @S^*$ labels each operation with a method-call
summary, and orders non-overlapping operations:
\begin{itemize}

  \item $O = \set{ \<op>(e_i) : 0 \le i < |e| \text{ and } e_i \in C }$,

  \item $\<op>(e_i) < \<op>(e_j)$ if{f} $i < j$, $e_i \in R$, and $e_j \in C$.

  \item $f(o) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    m(u) => v     & \text{if } m(u)_o \in e \text{ and } \<ret>(v)_o \in e \\
    m(u) => \bot  & \text{if } m(u)_o \in e \text{ and } \<ret>(\_)_o \not\in e
  \end{array}
  \right.$

\end{itemize}
An operation of $h$ labeled by $@l\in \<Labels>$ is called an \emph{$@l$
operation}. The histories admitted by $L$ are $H(L) = \set{ H(e) : e \in E(L)
}$.

\begin{example}

  Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(b) depicts the history of the execution in
  Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(a). Arrows depict the order relation modulo
  transitivity. Operations $o_1$ and $o_2$ are ordered in $h$ if $o_1$'s return
  precedes $o_2$'s call. For example, $\<push>(1)$ precedes $\<pop>=>3$.
  However, $\<pop>=>1$ is incomparable to $\<pop>=>3$ because $\<pop>=>1$'s
  return comes after $\<pop>=>3$'s call, and $\<pop>=>3$'s return comes after
  $\<pop>=>1$'s call. The order among operations' call actions is irrelevant,
  as is the order among their return actions.

\end{example}

While the general concept of histories allows arbitrary partial orders of
operations, any history $H(e)$ arising from an LTS execution $e$ falls into a
restricted class called \emph{interval orders}. Intuitively, this is because
our execution model assumes that operations share a common notion of global
time: the actions in an execution are linearly ordered.

\begin{definition}

  An \emph{interval order} is a partial order $\tup{O,<}$ such that
  $o_1 < o_3$ and $o_2 < o_4$ implies $o_1 < o_4$ or $o_2 < o_3$.

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:intervals}

  The history $H(e) = \tup{O,f,<}$ of a well-formed execution $e$ forms an
  interval order $\tup{O,<}$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

  Suppose $o_1 < o_3$ and $o_2 < o_4$ in $H(e)$, and fix $i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4$
  such that $e_{i_1}$ and $e_{i_2}$ are the return actions of $o_1$ and $o_2$,
  and $e_{i_3}$ and $e_{i_4}$ are the call actions of $o_3$ and $o_4$; note
  that $i_1 < i_3$ and $i_2 < i_4$. Since $<$ linearly orders $\set{i_1, i_2,
  i_3, i_4}$, either $i_1 < i_4$, in which case $o_1 < o_4$, or $i_4 < i_1$, in
  which case $i_2 < i_4 < i_1 < i_3$, so $o_2 < o_3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:histories}

  Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(d) pictures the history in Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(b)
  as an interval order. Each operation is represented by an integer-bounded
  interval on the real number line such that $o_1 < o_2$ iff the interval
  associated to $o_1$ finishes before the interval associated to $o_2$.
  
\end{example}

\noindent
In this work we consider only histories of well-formed executions, i.e.,~those
forming interval orders, without explicit qualification.

This notion of histories gives rise to a natural order relating histories by
their operation ordering. Basically, a history $h_1$ is \emph{weaker} than
another history $h_2$ if $h_2$ contains all completed operations of $h_1$, and
preserves the order between $h_1$'s operations. The pending operations of $h_1$
can be either omitted or completed in $h_2$.

\begin{definition}

  Let $h_1 = \tup{O_1,<_1,f_1}$ and $h_2 = \tup{O_2,<_2,f_2}$. We say $h_1$ is
  \emph{weaker than} $h_2$, written $h_1 \preceq h_2$, when there exists an
  injection $g: O_2 -> O_1$ such that
  \begin{itemize}

    \item $o \in \<range>(g)$ when $f_1(o) = m(u) => v$ and $v \neq \bot$,

    \item $g(o_1) <_1 g(o_2)$ implies $o_1 <_2 o_2$ for each $o_1, o_2 \in O_2$,

    \item $f_1(g(o)) \ll f_2(o)$ for each $o \in O_2$.

  \end{itemize}
  where $(m_1(u_1) => v_1) \ll (m_2(u_2) => v_2)$ if{f} $m_1 = m_2$, $u_1 =
  u_2$, and $v_1 \in \set{ v_2, \bot }$. We say $h_1$ and $h_2$ are
  \emph{equivalent} when $h_1 \preceq h_2$ and $h_2 \preceq h_1$.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}

Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(c) pictures a history $h'$ weaker than the history $h$ in Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(b).
Note that $h'$ contains two pending $\<pop>=>\bot$ operations, one of them is completed in $h$ 
(it corresponds to the $\<pop>=>3$ operation) and one of them is omitted in $h$.

\end{example}

Throughout this work we do not distinguish between equivalent histories, and we
assume every set $H$ of histories is closed under inclusion of equivalent
histories, i.e.,~if $h_1$ and $h_2$ are equivalent and $h_1 \in H$, then $h_2
\in H$ as well.

\subsection{History Inclusion is Equivalent to Refinement}

Our notion of histories has two important properties which makes refinement
between libraries equivalent to containment between their history sets. The
first property is that libraries are closed under the weakening relation
$\preceq$. Essentially when $L$ admits the history $H(e)$ of an execution $e$,
then it also admits the history $H(e')$ of any $e'$ which is $~>$-derivable
from $e$. Our definitions of $~>$ and $\preceq$ coincide to imply $H(e')
\preceq H(e)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:lib:closed}

  If $h_1 \in H(L)$ and $h_2 \preceq h_1$ then $h_2 \in H(L)$.

\end{lemma}

A history $h$ is essentially an abstraction of the set $\set{ e : H(e) = h}$ of
executions which preserve an order between returns preceding calls. The closure
properties of Definition~\ref{def:library} ensure that a library $L$ admits all
executions $e$ with $H(e) \in H(L)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:lib:execs}
  
  $E(L) = \set{ e \in (C\u R)^* : H(e) \in H(L) }$.

\end{lemma}

Lemmas~\ref{lem:lib:closed} and~\ref{lem:lib:execs} ultimately imply the
equivalence between refinement and history inclusion. Essentially, any given
history $h$ of a library $L_1$ can be captured by a program $P_h$ whose
observations witness the ordering among $h$'s operations. However, its observations
cannot forbid additional orderings between $h$'s operations (this is due to the closure
properties in Definition~\ref{def:programs}).
The refinement $L_1\leq L_2$ implies that $L_2$ also admits those observations, through one or more
possibly-stronger histories $h'$. It then follows from
Lemma~\ref{lem:lib:closed} that $L_2$ also admits $h \preceq h'$. For the
reverse direction, it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:lib:execs} that history
inclusion implies inclusion of executions, and ultimately observations.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:equivalence}

  $L_1 \leq L_2$ if{f} $H(L_1) \subseteq H(L_2)$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  
  ($\Rightarrow$) Let $h = \tup{O,<,f} \in H(L_1)$; we show $h \in H(L_2)$ by
  constructing a program $P_h$ over actions $@S$ which only admits executions
  with histories stronger than $h$:
  \begin{align*}
    \forall e \in E(P_h).\ |(e|@S)| = n \implies h \preceq H(e) \text{,}
  \end{align*}
  where $n = |\set{ o \in O : f(o) = m(u)=>v\neq \bot}|$ is the number of
  completed operations in $h$. Given such a program $P_h$, taking any execution
  $e_1 \in E(P_h \x L_1)$ with $|(e_1|@S)| = n$, we must also have an execution
  $e_2 \in E(P_h \x L_2)$ such that $(e_2|@S) = (e_1|@S)$ by definition of $L_1
  <= L_2$. Since $|(e_2|@S)| = n$ and $e_2 \in E(P_h)$, we also know that $h
  \preceq H(e_2)$, and since $(e_2 | C \u R) \in E(L_2)$, we have $H(e_2) \in
  H(L_2)$, along with any history weaker than $H(e_2)$ by
  Lemma~\ref{lem:lib:closed}, namely $h$.

  We construct $P_h = \tup{Q,@S,q_0,@d}$ over alphabet $@S = C \u R \u \set{a}$
  whose states $Q : O -> \<Bools>^2$ track operations called/completed status.
  The initial state is $q_0 = \set{ o |-> \tup{\bot,\bot} : o \in O}$.
  Transitions are given by,
  \begin{align*}
    & \text{for each } q \in Q, o \in O, m \in \<Methods>, v \in \<Vals> \\
    & \quad \text{if } f(o) = m(v) => \_
      \text{ and } q(o') \text{ for all } o' < o \text{ then} \\
    & \qquad q[o |-> \bot,\bot] \xrightarrow{m(v)_o} q[o |-> \top,\bot] \\
    & \quad \text{ if } f(o) = m(\_) => v \text{ then} \\
    & \qquad q[o |-> \top,\bot] \xrightarrow{\<ret>(v)_o}
      \cdot \xrightarrow{a} q[o |-> \top,\top] \\
    & \quad \text{ if } f(o) = m(\_) => \bot \text{ then} \\
    & \qquad q[o |-> \top,\bot] \xrightarrow{\<ret>(v)_o} q[o |-> \top,\top]
  \end{align*}
  It is routine to verify that $P_h$ is a program according to
  Definition~\ref{def:programs}.
  Moreover, in any execution $e \in E(P_h)$, the call $m(u)_o$ of any operation $o$ must
  come after the return $\<ret>(v)_{o'}$ of each $o'<o$. Furthermore, all
  completed operations of $h$ are completed in $e$ if and only if $(e|@S) =
  a^n$. Note that $e$ may contain more completed operations than $h$ (because
  of the last transition rule) but less pending operations (because the transition
  rule corresponding to the call of a pending operation may not have been applied in $e$). 
  It follows that $|(e|@S)| = n \implies h \preceq H(e)$.

  ($\Leftarrow$)
  Let $P$ be a program over actions $@S$, and $e \in E(P \x L_1)$; we show that
  $e \in E(P \x L_2)$. Since $(e | C \cup R) \in E(L_1)$, we know $H(e) \in
  H(L_1)$ by definition of $H(L_1)$, and then $H(e) \in H(L_2)$ by hypothesis.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:lib:execs} we deduce $(e | C \cup R) \in E(L_2)$, and
  thus by definition of LTS composition, $e \in E(P \x L_2)$.
\end{proof}

\section{Observational Refinement}
\label{sec:refinement}

% Standard correctness criteria for software library implementations are their
% conformance to \emph{reference implementations}. The literature captures such
% conformance with the notion of \emph{observational refinement}: is every
% behavior of a program using a given library also possible when using instead
% its reference implementation?

We formalize the criterion of \emph{observational refinement} using a simple
yet universal model of computation, namely labeled transition systems (LTS).
This model captures shared-memory programs with an arbitrary number of threads,
abstracting away the details of any particular programming system irrelevant to
our development.

A \emph{labeled transition system} $A = (Q,@S,q_0,@d)$ over the
possibly-infinite alphabet $@S$ is a possibly-infinite set $Q$ of states with
initial state $q_0 \in Q$, and a transition relation $@d \subseteq Q \x @S \x
Q$. The $i$th symbol of a sequence $e \in @S^*$ is denoted $e_i$. An
\emph{execution} of $A$ is a sequence $e \in @S^*$ such that for some $q_1,
q_2, .., q_{|e|} \in Q$, we have $@d(q_i,e_i,q_{i+1})$ for each $i$ such that
$0 \le i < |e|$. The projection $e|@G$ is the maximum subsequence of $e$ over
alphabet $@G$. $E(A)$ denotes the set of $A$'s executions, and $E(A)|@G$ their
projections over $@G$ (note that $E(A)$ is prefix closed). 
The \emph{synchronous product} $A_1 \x A_2$ of two LTSs
is defined as usual, respecting $E(A_1 \x A_2)|(@S_1 \n @S_2) = E(A_1)|@S_2 \n
E(A_2)|@S_1$.

%\begin{example}
%  \label{ex:threads:1}
%
%  A multithreaded system $\tup{S,L,@S,s_0,@l_0,n,->}$ of $n$ threads with
%  shared states $S$, local states $L$, actions $@S$, and per-thread transition
%  relation $-> \subseteq (S \x L) \x @S \x (S \x L)$ is modeled by the LTS
%  $\tup{Q,@S,q_0,@d}$ with states $Q = S \x L^n$ and initial state $q_0 =
%  \tup{s_0, @l_0, .., @l_0}$, which includes a transition
%  \begin{align*}
%    @d(\tup{s, @l_1, .., @l_n}, a, \tup{s', @l_1', .., @l_n'})
%  \end{align*}
%  iff $\tup{s,@l_i} \overset{a}{\rightarrow} \tup{s',@l_i'}$ for some $i$, and
%  $@l_j = @l_j'$ for $j \neq i$.
%  
%  \todo{actions should be associated to a thread}
%
%\end{example}

\subsection{Libraries}

Programs interact with libraries by calling named library \emph{methods}, which
receive \emph{parameter values} and yield \emph{return values} upon completion.
We fix arbitrary sets $\<Methods>$ and $\<Vals>$ of method names and
parameter/return values. 

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:methods}

  The method and value sets for the stack implementation in
  Figure~\ref{fig:treiber} are $\<Methods> = \set{ \<push>, \<pop> }$ and
  $\<Vals> = \<Nats> \u \set{ {\tt EMPTY} }$.

\end{example}

\noindent
We fix an arbitrary set $\<Ops>$ of operation identifiers, and for given sets
$\<Methods>$ and $\<Vals>$ of methods and values, we fix the sets
\begin{align*}
  & C = \set{ m(v)_o : m \in \<Methods>, v \in \<Vals>, o \in \<Ops> }
  \text{, and } \\
  & R = \set{ \<ret>(v)_o : v \in \<Vals>, o \in \<Ops> }  
\end{align*}
of \emph{call actions} and \emph{return actions}; each call action $m(v)_o$
combines a method $m \in \<Methods>$ and value $v \in \<Vals>$ with an
\emph{operation identifier} $o \in \<Ops>$. Operation identifiers are used to
pair call and return actions. We denote the operation identifier of a
call/return action $c$ by $\<op>(c)$. Call and return actions $c \in C$ and $r
\in R$ are \emph{matching}, written $c \match r$, when $\<op>(c) = \<op>(r)$. A
word $e \in @S^*$ over alphabet $@S$, such that $(C \u R) \subseteq @S$, is
\emph{well formed} when:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Each return is preceded by a matching call: \\
  $e_j \in R$ implies $e_i \match e_j$ for some $i < j$.

  \item Each operation identifier is used in at most one call/return: \\
  $\<op>(e_i) = \<op>(e_j)$ and $i < j$ implies $e_i \match e_j$.

\end{itemize}
We say that the well-formed word $e \in @S^*$ is \emph{sequential} when
\begin{itemize}

  \item Operations do not overlap: \\
  $e_i, e_k \in C$ and $i < k$ implies $e_i \match e_j$ for some $i < j < k$.

\end{itemize}
Well-formed words represent executions. We assume every set of well-formed
words is closed under isomorphic renaming of operation identifiers. For
notational convenience, we often associate $\<Ops>$ with $\<Nats>$,
e.g.,~writing $m(u)_1$ and $\<ret>(v)_2$ in place of $m(u)_{o_1}$ and
$\<ret>(v)_{o_2}$. An operation $o$ of an execution $e$ is \emph{completed}
when both call and return actions $m(u)_o$ and $\<ret>(v)_o$ of $o$ occur in
$e$, and is otherwise \emph{pending}.

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:executions}

  The well-formed words
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
     \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>_1\ \<ret>(0)_3\ \<ret>(0)_2
    \text{\normalsize, and } 
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>_1\ \<ret>(0)_2
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  represent executions in which one call to the $\<push>(0)$ method overlaps
  with two calls to $\<pop>$. In the first execution both calls to $\<pop>$
  have matching return actions $\<ret>(0)$, i.e., the operations $2$ and $3$ are completed,
  while operation $3$ is pending in the second, it has no matching return.

\end{example}

Libraries dictate the execution of methods between their call and return
points. Accordingly, a library cannot prevent a method from being called,
though it can decide not to return. Furthermore, any library action performed
in the interval between call and return points can also be performed should the
call have been made earlier, and/or the return made later. Our technical
results rely on these properties. A library thus allows any sequence of
invocations to its methods made by \emph{some} program.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:library}

  A \emph{library} $L$ is an LTS over alphabet $C \u R$ such that each
  execution $e \in E(L)$ is well formed, and
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Call actions $c \in C$ cannot be disabled: \\
    $e \cdot e' \in E(L)$ implies $e \cdot c \cdot e' \in E(L)$
    if $e \cdot c \cdot e'$ is well formed.
  
    \item Call actions $c \in C$ cannot disable other actions: \\
    $e \cdot a \cdot c \cdot e' \in E(L)$ implies $e \cdot c \cdot a \cdot e' \in E(L)$.
  
    \item Return actions $r \in R$ cannot enable other actions: \\
    $e \cdot r \cdot a \cdot e' \in E(L)$ implies $e \cdot a \cdot r \cdot e' \in E(L)$.
  
  \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\noindent
We write $e_1 ~> e_2$ when $e_2$ can be derived from $e_1$ by applying zero or
more of the above rules. The \emph{closure} of a set $E$ of executions under
$~>$ is denoted $\overline{E}$.

Note that even a library that implements \emph{atomic methods}, e.g.,~by
guarding method bodies with a global-lock acquisition, admits executions in
which method calls and returns overlap. A library which accesses the client's
thread identifiers can be modeled by taking thread identifiers as method
parameters.

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:libraries}

  Any library which admits the execution
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<ret>_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>(0)_2
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  with sequential calls to $\<push>$ and $\<pop>$ must also admit
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>_1\ \<ret>(0)_2
    \text{ \normalsize and }
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>_1\ \<ret>(0)_2
    \text{\normalsize,}
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  among others, yet need not admit an execution
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>_1\ \<ret>(0)_3\ \<ret>(0)_2
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  with two completed $\<pop>$ operations returning $0$.
  
\end{example}

A $L$ library is called \emph{atomic} if it is defined by the closure of some
set $E$ of sequential executions, i.e.,~$E(L) = \overline{E}$. When such a set
$E$ exists, it is unique, and we call it \emph{the kernel of $L$}, denoted by
$\ker L$. Note that $\ker L$ contains only completed operations since $e_1
\cdot e_2 ~> e_1 \cdot c \cdot e_2$, for any unmatched call $c$. Atomic
libraries are typically considered as specifications for concurrent objects.

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:atomic_stack}

  The \emph{atomic stack} is the library whose kernel is the set of sequential
  executions for which the return value of each $\<pop>$ operation is either
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item the argument value $v$ to the last unmatched $\<push>$ operation, or
    
    \item {\tt EMPTY} if there are no unmatched $\<push>$ operations.

  \end{itemize}
  In practice, the atomic stack can be implemented by guarding the methods
  of a ``sequential'' stack object by global-lock acquisition.

\end{example}


\subsection{Refinement between Libraries}

Refinement between libraries is defined with respect to the observable actions
of programs which invoke library methods. Complementary to libraries, programs
control their execution outside of method call and return points. Accordingly,
any program action performed in the interval between call and return points can
also be performed should the call have been made later, and/or the return made
earlier. A program thus allows any sequence of matching returns generated by
\emph{some} implementation of the methods it invokes.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:programs}

  A \emph{program} $P$ over actions $@S$ is an LTS over alphabet $(@S \uplus C
  \uplus R)$ where each execution $e \in E(P)$ is well formed, and
  \begin{itemize}

  	\item Call actions $c \in C$ cannot enable other actions: \\
    $e \cdot c \cdot a \cdot e' \in E(P)$ implies
    $c \match a$ or $e \cdot a \cdot c \cdot e' \in E(P)$.

    \item Return actions $r \in R$ cannot disable other actions: \\
    $e \cdot a \cdot r \cdot e' \in E(P)$ implies
    $a \match r$ or $e \cdot r \cdot a \cdot e \in E(P)$.

    \item Return actions $r \in R$ cannot be disabled: \\
    $e \cdot e' \in E(P)$ implies $e \cdot r \cdot e' \in E(L)$
    if $e \cdot r \cdot e'$ is well formed.

  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:programs}

  Any program which admits the execution
  \scriptsize
    \begin{align*}
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>(0)_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>_1
    \text{\normalsize ,}
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  with two sequential $\<pop>$ calls concurrent with $\<push>$, must also admit
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
    &\<push>(0)_1\ \<ret>_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>(0)_2\ \<pop>_3
    \quad \text{\normalsize and} \\
    & \<push>(0)_1\ \<ret>_1\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>(0)_2\ \<pop>_3\ \<ret>({\tt EMPTY})_3
    \text{\normalsize ,} 
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  among others, in which all three calls are sequential and the second $\<pop>$
  may return (with any value), yet need not admit an execution
  \scriptsize
  \begin{align*}
    \<push>(0)_1\ \<ret>_1\ \<pop>_3\ \<pop>_2\ \<ret>(0)_2
    \text{\normalsize ,}
  \end{align*}
  \normalsize
  in which the two calls to $\<pop>$ are concurrent. The set of executions
  admitted by a program allows any possible implementation of the methods.
  While programs cannot force methods to execute concurrently, they can force
  methods to execute sequentially, e.g., by waiting for one to return before
  calling the next.
\end{example}

%\begin{example}
%  \label{ex:threads:2}
%
%  A multithreaded program $P$ with $n$ threads, e.g.,~as defined in
%  Example~\ref{ex:threads:1}, only admits executions with at most $n$
%  overlapping method calls. A library which accesses $P$'s thread identifiers
%  can be modeled by defining the set $\<Methods>$ of methods to include thread
%  identifiers as method parameters.
%
%\end{example}

Refinement between libraries $L_1$ and $L_2$ means that any program execution
possible with $L_1$ is also possible with $L_2$.
\begin{definition}

  The library $L_1$ \emph{refines} $L_2$, written $L_1 \leq L_2$, iff
  \begin{align*}
    E(P \x L_1)|@S \ \subseteq \ E(P \x L_2)|@S
  \end{align*}
  for all programs $P$ over actions $@S$.

\end{definition}
Note that $\leq$ is a preorder over libraries. As library and program alphabets
only intersect on call and return actions $C \cup R$, our formalization
supposes that programs and libraries communicate only through method calls and
returns, and not, e.g.,~through shared random-access memory.

\begin{example}

  The incorrect Treiber's stack implementation of Figure~\ref{fig:treiber}
  does not refine an atomic lock-based reference implementation, since the
  execution of Figure~\ref{fig:stacks} is admitted by its composition with
  the two-thread program of Figure~\ref{fig:treiber}.

\end{example}

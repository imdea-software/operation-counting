\subsection{Histories of bounded length}

We show that deciding if a history of a concurrent register, of bounded length, is correct w.r.t. the atomic register, i.e., it is also a history of the atomic register, is decidable in polynomial time. The same problem for arbitrary histories is NP-complete since it is equivalent to deciding if an execution of the concurrent register is linearizable w.r.t. a sequential register (by Proposition~\ref{prop:atom}).

\begin{theorem}
Let $h$ be a history of a concurrent register, of bounded length. Deciding if $h\in At[Reg]$ is polynomial time.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $h$ be a history of a concurrent register of length $K$. 
\end{proof}

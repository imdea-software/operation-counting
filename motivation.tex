\section{Motivating Example}
\label{sec:motivation}

Figure~\ref{fig:treiber} lists the implementation of the non-blocking Treiber's
stack~\cite{Treiber'86}, which provides {\tt push} and {\tt pop} methods. This
implementation stores {\tt push}ed elements in a singly-linked list rooted at
{\tt Top}, but avoids blocking lock acquisitions in favor of non-blocking
compare-and-swap ({\tt CAS}) operations in order to maximize parallelism,
allowing methods to interleave their internal actions; in one atomic step, the
{\tt CAS} operation assigns {\tt Top = n} only if {\tt Top == t}.

% The first lock-based implementation ensures that methods execute atomically by
% holding a lock for the duration of each operation, and stores {\tt push}ed
% elements in a singly-linked list rooted at {\tt S->Top}. The second
% implementation of Treiber~\cite{Treiber'86} stores its elements in the same
% singly-linked list structure,

Unfortunately this nonblocking implementation suffers from a subtle concurrency
bug, now commonly known as an ``ABA'' bug~\cite{tr/ibm/Michael04}. This bug
manifests via the execution depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:stacks}(a).
Essentially, Thread~1 wrongfully assumes the absence of interference from other
threads on the successful {\tt CAS} operation. Thread~1 is preempted right
before executing its {\tt CAS} in the {\tt pop} method; at that moment, its
{\tt t} variable points to the first element in the list at address {\tt 0xFF}
added by {\tt push(1)}, and {\tt n == NULL}. While Thread~2 updates the list
with two additional elements, added by {\tt push(2)} and {\tt push(3)}, the
{\tt t} variable of Thread~1 still points to the list's first element at
address {\tt 0xFF}, which was freed by Thread~2's call to {\tt pop}, and
reallocated in the call to {\tt push(3)}. When Thread~1 resumes, its {\tt CAS}
succeeds, effectively removing two elements from the list instead of one. The
final {\tt pop} of Thread~2 thus erroneously returns {\tt EMPTY}. Intuitively,
this is a problem because the {\tt EMPTY} value should not have been returned
since more elements have been pushed than popped prior to Thread~2's final {\tt
pop} operation.

This bug exposes the fact that our {\tt CAS}-based implementation does not
conform to programmers' expectations of a stack object whose operations execute
atomically, e.g., by holding a lock for the duration of each operation.
In particular, the assignment {\tt z = EMPTY} should never have
been observed in an execution of the given program. 

This idea of conformance is rigorously captured by the formal notion of
\emph{observational refinement}. Essentially, an implementation $L_1$ of a
concurrent object ``refines'' another implementation $L_2$ if every observable
behavior of a program using $L_1$ is also observable using $L_2$. This property
clearly does not hold between the {\tt CAS}-based implementation of
Figure~\ref{fig:treiber} and a lock-based implementations, since {\tt y = 1; x
= 3; z = EMPTY} is observable using the {\tt CAS}-based implementation, yet not
using the lock-based implementation.
